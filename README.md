# Hexagrid!
Hexagrid is a template project that I plan to use to make a turn-based game with.
As of now, it's just a collection of scripts and assets that make working with a hexagon grid system easier.

## Current features in Hexagrid!
* Generating a grid of hexagons
* Procedural biome generation
* Pathing with A* and TwinStarÂ©
* Pathfinding agents can "follow" other agents
* Outline highlight shader
* Basic fog of war
* More map generation settings
* Custom map generation (yay!)

## Planned/ in progress features
* Spell targeting system
* Grid rearanging
* City building
* Support for endless map generation
  * Grid cell pooling
* More AI options
* Turnbased game mode
* Movement/Ability '*range*'
